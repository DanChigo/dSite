                                        <p> I served as a research fellow on a project led by Dr. Katie Jarriel focused on developing a computational model of Micronesian
                                            navigational practices. The central question was: How can traditional navigation practices build community resilience and 
                                            interconnectivity in the time of climate change and post-pandemic disruption? As a member of the team we developed a new methodology combining 
                                            Indigenous knowledge, computer models, and data analysis to build a model for stakeholders (academics, and actual navigators) to use. The model was
                                            built using Python using Pandas and MesaGeo. 
                                        </p>
                                        <p>
                                            We then presented our initial findings to stakeholders at University of Hawaii at Hilo during a trip to Hawaii in Summer 2024. During that
                                            trip we were able to meet with actual navigators and validate the model with their live feedback. We then developed a website 
                                            using an Agile workflow to make the model accessible to our stakeholders off the mainland. The website was built with React with a Flask server. 
                                            The model can be found <a href="https://project-oceanic.vercel.app" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a>.
